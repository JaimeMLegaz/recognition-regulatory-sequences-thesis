## Initial setup

Loading all required libraries

```{r}
library(biomaRt)
```

## Obtaining the sequences

First of all, we have to connect to ensembl.

```{r}
ensembl = useEnsembl(biomart="ensembl", dataset="hsapiens_gene_ensembl", GRCh=37)
```

Then, we ask ensembl for the positive and negative Promoter sequences.

```{r}

PosGenes <- scan(file = "Data/PositiveGenes", what = "raw") # A file containing the positive genes
PosSequences <- getSequence(id = PosGenes, upstream = 250, type = "hgnc_symbol", seqType = "coding_gene_flank", mart = ensembl)

NegGenes <- scan(file = "Data/NegativeGenes", what = "raw") # A file containing 764 specific negative genes
NegSequences <- getSequence(id = NegGenes, upstream = 250, type = "hgnc_symbol", seqType = "coding_gene_flank", mart = ensembl)

```

Some of this sequences appear as unavailable. We have to remove those rows.

``` {r}
PosSequences <- PosSequences[-which(PosSequences$coding_gene_flank == "Sequence unavailable"),]
```

Finally, we can save our data into some files for their later use.

```{r}
write.csv(PosSequences,file="Data/Promoters/PositivePromoterSequences_untreated", row.names = FALSE, quote = FALSE)
write.csv(NegSequences,file="Data/Promoters/NegativePromoterSequences_untreated", row.names = FALSE, quote = FALSE)
```
